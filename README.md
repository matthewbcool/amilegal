## Vision
The goal of this project is to help flight attendants navigate tricky contract legalities surrounding their duty days through the app which should be installable on their devices and work offline. 
They will use it when they are tired after working for maybe 12 hours or more and wanting to see quickly if they can legally continue to work (duty days can run from 12-19 hours depending on several factors).
We want them to be able to navigate through the stepper quickly, see the text easily so they can get the answers they need to possible call crew tracking or make any arrangements they need to.

This will save them time, be convenient, and reduce stress for crew as well as ease the load on crew tracking services. 

## To run
```yarn start```
